Notes to Self :-
All possible patters from Subsequence

1. Print All the Subsequence
2. Print all Sq which sums to K
3. Print only 1st Sq which sums to K -> return T/F and avoid further recursion calls if you get T
4. Print the count of Sq which sums to K -> return 1/0 and add all f(); return.


*Note In order to understand Printing all subsequence in absolute clear way..... Just take the example which striver gave in previous video

Now create a table of all the output and match it with the power set. A magic will happen and you will be totally blown away 🔥🔥🔥

// Sort the List using a Comparator
        ans.sort((a, b) -> {
            // Compare based on list size first
            if (a.size() != b.size()) {
                return Integer.compare(a.size(), b.size());
            }
            // If sizes are equal, compare lexicographically
            return a.toString().compareTo(b.toString());
});
